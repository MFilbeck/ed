So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. 
We have heard of those princes’ heroic campaigns.
There was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead-benches, rampaging among foes. 
This terror of the hall-troops had come far. 
A foundling to start with, he would flourish later on as his powers waxed and his worth was proved. 
In the end each clan on the outlying coasts beyond the whale-road had to yield to him and begm' to pay tribute. 
That was one good king.
Afterwards a boy-child was born to Shield, a cub in the yard, 
a comfort sent by God to that nation.
He knew what they had tholed, the long times and troubles they’d come through without a leader; 
so the Lord of Life, the glorious Almighty, made tlu's man renowned. 
Shield had fathered a famous son: Beow’s name was known through the north. And a young prin'ce must be prudent lik'e that, givm'g freely while his father lives so that afterwards in age when fightm'g starts
He was well regarded and ruled the Danes for a long time after his father took leave of his life on earth. And then his heir, the great Halfdane, held sway for as long as he lived, their elder and warlord. He was four times a father, this fighter prince: one by one they entered the world, Heorogar, Hrothgar, the good Halga and a daughter, I have heard, who was Onela’s queen, a balm in bed to the battle—scarred Swede.

King Hmthgnr builds Heoml Hall
to be a mighty army. 80 his mind turned
to hall-building: he handed down orders
for men to work on a great mead-hall meant to be a wonder of the world forever;
it would be his throne—room and there he would dispense
his God-given goods to young and old—
but not the common land or people’s lives.
Far and wide through the world, I have heard,
orders for work to adorn that wallstead
were sent to many peoples. And soon it stood there,
firu"shed and ready, in full view,
the hall of halls. Heorot was the name
he had settled on it, whose utterance was law.
Nor did he renege, but doled out rings
and torques at the table. The hall towered,
its gables wide and high and awaiting
a barbarous burning. That doom abided,
but in time it would come: the killer instinct
unleashed among in-laws, the blood-lust rampant.
